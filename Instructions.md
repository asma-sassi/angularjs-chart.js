Instructions:
I- Installing NPM
    1. First of all, to manipulate packages of application we need Node Package Manager(NPM)
    2. We need to download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
    3. Update npm in CMD > npm install npm@latest -g
    4. npm init to create package.json where all project's details is included in there (packages installed, version, etc.)
II- Installing packages:
    1. In order to build an AngularJS App, we need to install angular package > npm install --save angular
    2. To make our App responsive, we install bootstrap package > npm install bootstrap@3
    3. Install jquery libraries for bootstrap needs > npm install jquery
    4. To use global icons, we install font-awesome > npm install font-awesome@4
    5. To be able to use app's routing, we install angular-route > npm install angular-route
II- Project structure: 
    .Now, we will create two files in the root directory. app.js and index.html
    1. index.html 
    2. app.js: include routing
    3. assets: all necessary libraries
    4. node_modules: It contains packages that are installed by npm
    5. controllers
    6. views: partial views that will be included later in index.html
III- Project development:
    1. Build index.html and call libraries in it
    2. Build header.html, then call it into index.html
    3. The same thing with footer.html
    4. Configure routes and views in app.js
